A series documenting my journey of re-learning Kathak and exploring how learning this art form is changing my relationship with 
grace, myself, emulating others, getting in touch with my feminine again. 

I am learning to refine myself, tapping into what grace looks like on me, what elegance looks like on me, what flexibility is, 
what precision and beauty and refinement feels like on me. 

I am also learning to deal with not emulating the first thing I see, instead, separating the art from the artist and learning 
to pick up the art instead of mirroring the artist. 

There is also a large level of discipline, flexibility, poise, grace and rhythm that needs to be tapped into and that one 
develops slowly as one learns more and more dance.
