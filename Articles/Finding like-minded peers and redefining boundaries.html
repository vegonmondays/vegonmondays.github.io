How is that you always want to find people who say 'yes' to your ideas, or agree with them, and even a little bit of friction causes you to lose out on conversations that would have otherwise opened up new perspectives for you? 
Is that what we are missing as people who are used to getting what you want, when we want it? 
Do we forget that people and experiences are not meant to be picked and chosen, that they are meant to be experienced, no matter how different, far out from our comfort zone they are or how unnatural it is for us? 

I recently saw the discussion between Shruti Hasaan and Ranveer Allahabadia where she talked about how it is a difficult time for everyone, planetarily. 
What if it isn't? What if we're subconscious victims of comparison, always looking over the fence at others who we think have it easier? 
What if words like trauma, stress and self-care are being thrown around so much that we constantly feel we are not living unless we are doing exactly what we want, 
with really low effort - whether it is physical or mental? What if it's because we've entered a state of laziness and uncertainty and not knowing 
where our boundaries lie and what is working and what is not such that everything we do is either not enough or too much and we cannot accept that?
