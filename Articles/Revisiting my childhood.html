Revisiting my childhood - a series where I walk myself through things I did when I was a kid, I cover my experience of the event
how I felt and hopefully - remember what I learnt from doing it to carry that lesson with me going forward 

I also want to include what my emotional and mental states were then - just to get to know myself better and find pieces of resilience in them if I can
