Revisiting my childhood - a series where I walk myself through things I did when I was a kid, I cover my experience of the event
how I felt and hopefully - remember what I learnt from doing it to carry that lesson with me going forward 

I also want to include what my emotional and mental states were then - just to get to know myself better and find pieces of resilience in them if I can 

The disclaimer here is by reclaiming my childhood and my childhood experiences, I should also be combating the 'I will fail if I am 
not perfect + I will use perfection as a shield against failure because I cannot see myself fail" instead I want to use this series as a way to reclaim
my zest for life, rediscovering how I was good at everything because I enjoyed trying new things, rediscovering my focus for doing things 
while enjoying the process and thus being good at it, or letting go of the idea of doing things and then enjoying them because I am good at it, 
but instead, learning to do things for the sake of doing it and seeing where it goes instead of focusing myself to be 'good' according to 
standards that exist outside or standards of commercial success that we are usually used to. Also, dealing with the loss that I feel
when I think that I may not be good at something and how to combat that loss to just focus on what I am doing. 

I also want to go back and see how I studied and what I need to fix so that I learn better going forward.
