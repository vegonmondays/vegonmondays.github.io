What does progress look like? 
What do you stop at? What do you celebrate? 
Do you never celebrate the small wins? How do you push the limits of what is being done? 
How much is it okay sticking to the basics? How much is publishing necessary? Will it find its own standards that evaluate it
and pass it? Will it find its own space?
