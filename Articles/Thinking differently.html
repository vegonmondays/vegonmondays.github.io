How do I begin thinking differently? 
Of course, most of the things that I relate to today are things that most of the population is thinking about, or has thought 
about, or has experienced. How do I get over this phase of thinking like everyone else to then think of the future in a way that 
can help shape it? How do I push the boundaries of my thinking, my experience to be bigger than the mundane? 
How okay am I going to be with not being relatable to mostly everyone I speak to? Even if I am okay with it - how do I combat the 
superiority complex I might develop as a defense mechanism in thinking 'people don't understand me because the stuff I am talking about is much 
more advanced than what any of them have studied'? Will I even develop it? How can I stop it from developing? 

More than anything, though - how do I start thinking differently? Appreciating the finer, better things in life? Looking for what's 
next and what I want to do next and how I can help define the future? Is there something different I need to do? 
Do I read the news every day? Or what do I hold onto in my current routine? Is whatever I am going to think of right now - is it going 
to be removed from practical life because I am thinking of it while I am in a bubble of unemployment?
