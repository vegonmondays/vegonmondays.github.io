Oftentimes, I myself fall into the trap of 'oh, they don't understand me, I am one of a kind' or 'a good product like that won't have any 
takers, people go for the mediocre things in life'
I have realised that, a lot of times, people box themselves in giving themselves these reasons to justify their cowardice of not 
trying, or not putting themselves out there. 
There's also a certain romanticism in both distancing oneself from one's peers around them and simultaenously placing oneself 
above others to somehow justify not owning up to what you want to do / what you want to make / stand up for something you believe in. 

While songs like 'Iris' by the Goo Goo Dolls are cult favourites especially because of their rainy and emotional rendition, 
it is today being glorified for being a 'loner' for the sake of being one, instead of being interpreted as an anthem that 
encourages one to take their own path and do what you want to do.
