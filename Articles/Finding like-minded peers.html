How is that you always want to find people who say 'yes' to your ideas, or agree with them, and even a little bit of friction causes you to lose out on conversations that would have otherwise opened up new perspectives for you? 
Is that what we are missing as people who are used to getting what you want, when we want it? 
Do we forget that people and experiences are not meant to be picked and chosen, that they are meant to be experienced, no matter how different, far out from our comfort zone they are or how unnatural it is for us?
