I initially used to give up whenever something did not feel extremely natural the first time
I did something different. 
The first time I went to a cafe, it did not feel exactly like home, so I did not concentrate on studying. 
The time I feel something isn't exactly easy, I give up on it, feeling I'm not doing it right 
or that it's not worth doing just because it doesn't feel natural or easy. 

This is something I am trying to work on and change as time passes, because I've realised that 
everything does not come easy and there is a greater chance that there will be resistance one faces 
as one does new things and that is the status quo - not ease.
